# SpaceX Rocket Cost Prediction
# Project background and context
SpaceX offers Falcon 9 launches at $62 million, a price significantly lower than competitors’ rates, which start at $165 million. The key to SpaceX’s pricing advantage is the reusability of the rocket’s first stage. Accurately predicting the first stage’s landing can help determine launch costs, providing crucial data for competitors aiming to outbid SpaceX.
# Problems you want to find answers
